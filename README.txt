This is a Propositional Modal Logic solver for Logic K.
It it will be soon expanded to other logics.

How to use:
    1. Download all the .py files
    2. Place them in one folder
    3. Open input.py with python interpreter
    4. Read some simple instructions in input.py
    5. Input your formula
    6. Run, test and get results
    7. And graphs (valid models)

I have used tableaux method to derive the solutions. Please make sure that you have a formula that will contain more
1 world, otherwise there will be no solution!
