Modal logic:
K: finished
    no properties
T: finished
    reflexive   []p -> p
B: finished
    symmetric   p -> []<>p
BT: finished
    symmetric and reflexive
K4: almost finished
    Transitive
S4: not started
    reflexive and transitive    []p -> [][]p
S5: not started
    S4 + <>p ->[]<>p
S4.3: not started
    same as S4 but additionally linear

-testing needs to be done, perhaps small errors can occur
